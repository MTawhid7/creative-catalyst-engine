Yes, absolutely. You are thinking like a lead developer. After a series of significant fixes, especially one related to the core development environment setup, the `README.md` is no longer just a documentâ€”it's a critical piece of project infrastructure. An inaccurate README can waste hours of a new developer's time.

Our recent debugging session revealed two major discrepancies:
1.  **The Python Version:** The `Prerequisites` section is dangerously misleading, as Python 3.13+ will fail during dependency installation.
2.  **The File Structure:** The repository map is now incorrect because we deleted `catalyst/utilities/log_formatter.py`.

I will now provide a completely rewritten `README.md` that corrects these issues and incorporates the lessons we learned into the setup and troubleshooting sections, making the onboarding process for the next developer much smoother.

The **Creative Catalyst Engine** is an AI-powered, idea-to-image pipeline delivered as a scalable and resilient web service. It transforms a simple creative brief into a multi-format fashion intelligence package: a structured trend report (JSON), an art-directed style guide, and a suite of editorial-quality images.

Built on a robust, modern stack of **FastAPI, ARQ, Redis, and ChromaDB**, the engine is fully containerized with Docker and managed by a simple `Makefile` command interface for perfect reproducibility and ease of use.

## 1. Getting Started

This project is fully containerized. The primary workflow uses a `Makefile` to simplify and orchestrate all Docker commands.

### Prerequisites

*   **Docker Desktop:** The primary requirement for running the application.
*   **Make:** A standard command-line tool, available by default on macOS and Linux.
*   **Python 3.12:** Required *only* for managing local dependencies and IDE integration.
    *   **IMPORTANT:** As of late 2025, a key dependency (`onnxruntime`, used by `chromadb`) does not support Python 3.13+. Using a newer Python version will cause dependency installation to fail.
    *   It is **highly recommended** to use a tool like `pyenv` to manage Python versions and ensure you are using a compatible one.

### First-Time Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MTawhid7/creative-catalyst-engine.git
    cd creative-catalyst-engine
    ```
2.  **Set Your Local Python Version:** (Recommended)
    If you have `pyenv` installed, set the correct Python version for this project.
    ```bash
    pyenv install 3.12
    pyenv local 3.12
    ```
3.  **Create Your Local Environment:**
    Set up a local virtual environment. This is used for IDE integration and dependency management tools.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Bootstrap `pip-tools`:** Before running the main dependency installation, install `pip-tools` into your new environment.
    ```bash
    pip install pip-tools
    ```
5.  **Create the `.env` File:**
    Copy the provided `.env.example` file to `.env`. This file is ignored by Git and will hold your secret keys.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
6.  **Configure Your Secrets:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in your secret keys (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `SENTRY_DSN`, `ASSET_BASE_URL`).

### Running the Application

The entire application stack is orchestrated with simple `make` commands.

1.  **Ensure Docker Desktop is running.**
2.  **Open a terminal** in the project's root directory (no `venv` needed for this step).
3.  **Build and Run the Services:**
    ```bash
    make up
    ```
    *   The first time you run this, the build process will be slow. Subsequent starts will be very fast.

The application is ready when you see logs from all services, including:
`Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:9500` and `ARQ worker started. Ready to process creative jobs.`

To stop the entire application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, then run `make down`.

---

## 2. Day-to-Day Workflow

### Interacting with the Engine

The recommended way to test the running service is with the provided interactive API client.

1.  **Start the application** with `make up`.
2.  **In a separate terminal,** modify the test prompt in `api_client/example.py`.
3.  **Run the client:**
    ```bash
    make run-client
    ```
    You will see a menu-driven interface to test the different generation and variation workflows.

### Modifying Code

The project is configured with a **live-sync volume**. When you save a change to a `.py` file, the change is instantly reflected inside the running Docker containers. The FastAPI server will automatically restart. To apply changes to the worker, you must manually restart it:
```bash
make restart-worker
```

### Managing Dependencies & Environments

This project uses `pip-tools` for robust, deterministic dependency management.

*   **To add or change a dependency:** Edit the high-level `requirements.in` or `dev-requirements.in` file.

*   **To update the lockfiles (`.txt`):**
    1.  Activate your local virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
    2.  Run the compile command: `make deps`

*   **To sync your local `venv` for VS Code:** After updating dependencies, sync your local environment to match the lockfiles. This is crucial for the VS Code Test Explorer and IntelliSense.
    ```bash
    make sync-venv
    ```

*   **To update the Docker test environment:** After updating dependencies, you must rebuild the Docker images.
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

### Running Scripts & Tests

Use `make` commands to execute one-off tasks inside a temporary container.

*   **To Clear All Caches:** `make clear-cache`
*   **To Run the Full Test Suite:** `make test`
*   **To Open a Shell Inside the Worker:** `make shell`

| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`make deps` fails with `DistributionNotFound` for `onnxruntime`**                     | Your local Python version is too new (e.g., 3.13+) and is not yet supported by a key dependency (`onnxruntime` from `chromadb`). **Solution:** Use `pyenv` to install and set a compatible version like **Python 3.12** for this project, as described in the 'First-Time Setup' guide. Then, recreate your virtual environment and re-run the `make deps` command. |
| **`make up` fails with a container name conflict**                                      | A container from a previous run was not properly shut down. **Solution:** Run `make down` to remove the old containers, then run `make up` again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Tests fail in VS Code with "pytest Not Installed" or "Import could not be resolved"** | Your local `venv` is out of sync with the project's dependencies. **Solution:** **1. Activate your environment:** `source venv/bin/activate`. **2. Run the sync command:** `make sync-venv`. **3. Reload VS Code:** Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run `Developer: Reload Window`.                                                                    |
| **`make test` fails but local tests pass (or vice-versa)**                              | The Docker test environment is out of sync. This happens after you change dependencies in `dev-requirements.in`. **Solution:** Run a clean build to update the image: `make build-clean`.                                                                                                                                                                           |

Check your Sentry dashboard.** The full traceback and context will be there. **2. Check the container logs** with `make logs-worker`.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Images not loading (404 Not Found)**                                                  | The `ASSET_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file is incorrect. It must be the public-facing IP address of your computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Getting old/cached results**                                                          | The L0 (Redis) or L1 (Chroma) caches are active. **Solution:** Run the master cache clearing utility: `make clear-cache`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
