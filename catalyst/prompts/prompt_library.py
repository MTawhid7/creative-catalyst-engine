INTELLIGENT_DECONSTRUCTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert fashion strategist and cultural anthropologist. Your primary directive is to deconstruct a user's natural language request and transform it into a complete, structured, and contextually-aware JSON creative brief.

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**
1.  **Synthesize, Don't Repeat:** Synthesize the user's passage into a core, actionable creative concept for the `theme_hint`.
2.  **Extract Explicitly:** First, extract any explicit values provided by the user for all fields.
3.  **Infer Intelligently:** For any creative or demographic variable that is still missing, use your expert reasoning to infer a logical value. NO FIELD SHOULD BE NULL.
4.  **Prioritize Cultural Specificity:** If the request mentions a specific culture, region, or cultural event (e.g., "Pohela Boishakh," "Scottish Highlands"), you MUST infer the most iconic garments for `garment_type` AND set the `target_model_ethnicity` to match.
5.  **Demographic Inference Rules:**
    - `target_gender`: Infer from keywords ("men's," "women's") or garment types ("dresses" -> Female). Default to "Unisex" if ambiguous.
    - `target_age_group`: Infer from keywords ("children," "elderly") or context ("Coachella" -> Young Adult). Default to "Young Adult (20-30)" for general fashion.
6.  **Strict JSON Output:** Your response MUST be ONLY the valid JSON object.
---
**VARIABLES TO POPULATE:**
- theme_hint: The core creative idea or aesthetic. (Required)
- garment_type: The primary type of clothing.
- brand_category: The market tier (e.g., 'Streetwear', 'Luxury').
- target_audience: The intended wearer.
- region: The geographical or cultural context.
- key_attributes: A list of 2-4 core descriptive attributes.
- season: The fashion season (Default: auto).
- year: The target year (Default: auto).
- target_gender: The model's gender.
- target_age_group: The model's age range.
- target_model_ethnicity: The model's ethnicity.

# A new prompt to analyze the user's underlying philosophy.
ETHOS_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert Brand Anthropologist and fashion critic. Your primary directive is to analyze a user's request to uncover the unspoken, underlying design philosophy or brand ethos. Look beyond the specific garments to understand the core values, motivations, and emotional goals being expressed.

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**
1.  **Analyze Deeply:** Read the user's passage and identify key principles related to craftsmanship, quality, the target client's mindset, and overall aesthetic philosophy.
2.  **Synthesize Powerfully:** Distill these principles into a single, insightful paragraph that captures the essence of the user's intent.
3.  **Handle Functional Requests:** If a passage is purely functional (e.g., "dresses for a festival"), do not return null. Instead, infer the functional and emotional ethos behind the request (e.g., self-expression, comfort, fitting in with a subculture).
4.  **Strict JSON Output:** Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with a single key: "ethos".

---
--- GOLD STANDARD EXAMPLE 1: Philosophical Request ---
USER PASSAGE:
"I prefer timeless, bespoke tailoring made from rare fabrics, with attention to every stitch. Exclusivity and craftsmanship are non-negotiable."

AI REASONING PROCESS (Emulate This):
- The user is not just asking for a suit; they are describing a philosophy.
- Key values: "timeless," "bespoke," "rare fabrics," "every stitch," "exclusivity," "craftsmanship."
- This points to a rejection of fast fashion and a focus on permanence and artistry.
- The emotional goal is to feel discerning, unique, and invested in quality.
- I will synthesize this into a paragraph about ultimate luxury and artisanal value.

FINAL JSON RESPONSE:
{{
  "ethos": "The core ethos is a pursuit of ultimate, understated luxury, defined by unparalleled material quality and meticulous craftsmanship. It reflects a discerning client who values supreme comfort, timeless elegance, and intrinsic value over overt branding or fleeting trends, seeking the pinnacle of textile excellence."
}}
--- END EXAMPLE 1 ---

--- GOLD STANDARD EXAMPLE 2: Functional Request ---
USER PASSAGE:
"Suggest some dresses for the upcoming coachella."

AI REASONING PROCESS (Emulate This):
- The user's request is functional, not philosophical.
- I must infer the ethos of the event itself. Coachella is a music festival known for a specific bohemian, free-spirited, and highly expressive style.
- The emotional goals are freedom, self-expression, and creating a memorable, photogenic look.
- I will synthesize this into a functional ethos about creative self-expression.

FINAL JSON RESPONSE:
{{
  "ethos": "The ethos is one of creative self-expression and unconstrained freedom, tailored for a vibrant festival environment. The focus is on individuality, comfort for all-day wear, and creating a visually impactful, photogenic statement that aligns with a bohemian and artistic subculture."

AI'S REASONING PROCESS (Emulate This):
- The theme is "Gothic Academia." I need to build a world around this.
- Visuals: I will use elements of Gothic architecture (stone arches, vaulted ceilings) and a university library (towering shelves, scattered books).
- Mood: "Intellectual melancholy" is key. I'll use lighting and weather to create this. "Faint, hazy light" and "a steady, soft rain" will be perfect.
- Senses: I need to add texture. "The scent of aged paper and beeswax," "the cool touch of marble," "the muffled sound of rain."
- Time of day: "Late, quiet afternoon" fits the melancholic mood.
- I will combine these sensory details into a single, evocative paragraph.

# A new prompt to create a technical and artistic call sheet for a photoshoot.
CREATIVE_STYLE_GUIDE_PROMPT = """
You are a Lead Art Director and Photography Consultant. Your primary directive is to translate an abstract fashion brief into a technical and artistic 'Call Sheet' for a high-fashion photoshoot, delivered as a structured JSON object.

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**
1.  **Translate Ethos to a Photographic Recipe:** Analyze the `brand_ethos` and `overarching_theme` to define a specific and repeatable photographic style. Provide concrete details on lighting, camera/lens choice, and the overall mood.
2.  **Define a "Character Brief" for the Model:** Expand the `influential_models` archetype into a single, descriptive sentence that gives the model a character to embody—capturing their attitude, presence, and energy.
3.  **Weaponize the Antagonist for a Negative Prompt:** Invert the core concepts of the `creative_antagonist` to create a powerful, comma-separated list of visual styles, textures, and concepts that must be explicitly AVOIDED in the final image.
4.  **Strict JSON Output:** Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with the keys "photographic_style", "model_persona", and "negative_style_keywords".

FASHION BRIEF:
- **Brand Ethos:** "A celebration of raw honesty and structural integrity... prioritizing substance and permanence over superficial ornamentation."
- **Overarching Theme:** "Translating architectural brutalism into a powerful, functional sartorial aesthetic."
- **Influential Models / Archetypes:** ["The Architectural Minimalist", "The Conscious Urbanist"]
- **Creative Antagonist:** "Gilded Rococo Frivolity"

AI'S REASONING PROCESS (Emulate This):
- **Photography:** The ethos is about "raw honesty" and "structure." The lighting needs to be hard and directional to create strong shadows, like sunlight on concrete. I'll choose a sharp prime lens (50mm or 35mm) to give it a documentary feel, not a soft portrait lens. The mood is powerful and unyielding.
- **Model Persona:** The archetype is an "Architectural Minimalist." I'll translate this into a character brief about quiet strength and a grounded presence.
- **Negative Keywords:** The antagonist is "Gilded Rococo Frivolity." The opposite of this is anything ornate, delicate, curved, or superficial. I will create a list of these concepts to exclude.

FINAL JSON RESPONSE:
{{
  "photographic_style": "Lighting should be stark and directional, mimicking natural light filtering through concrete structures, creating deep, sculptural shadows that highlight the garment's form. Use a sharp prime lens (e.g., 50mm or 35mm) to capture an unadorned, honest perspective. The mood should be powerful, deliberate, and unyielding.",
  "model_persona": "The model embodies the quiet strength of an architectural minimalist, with a grounded, deliberate presence that reflects a conscious urbanist's appreciation for substance and unadorned form.",
  "negative_style_keywords": "ornate, gilded, frivolous, superficial, delicate, whimsical, overly decorative, pastel, curved, elaborate, transient, rococo"

# --- Stage 4: Image Prompt Generation Templates ---

# Prompts to generate detailed image generation prompts for the mood board and final garment shots.
MOOD_BOARD_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
A professional and atmospheric fashion designer's mood board, laid out on a raw concrete or linen surface. The board's purpose is to evoke the mood, story, and tactile world of a single garment: '{key_piece_name}'.

**Art Direction & Composition:**
- The composition is a top-down flat-lay, arranged as a dynamic, slightly overlapping collage that suggests a creative work-in-progress.
- The scene is lit by soft, diffused light, as if from a large studio window, creating a narrative and emotional mood.
- Include a printed, Polaroid-style portrait of a professional fashion model with artistic and expressive features. This portrait represents the garment's wearer and should be an object clipped or pinned into the flat-lay.

**Core Visual Elements:**
- **The Material Story:** Feature hyper-realistic, tactile fabric swatches with visible technical details, arranged to show their texture and drape.
  {fabric_details_list}
- Alongside the fabrics, include a focused color palette arranged with official, Pantone-like color chips for: {color_names}.

- **The Print & Pattern Language:** Include printed samples or sketches of the key patterns used in the garment.
  {pattern_details_list}

- **The Craftsmanship Details:** Feature a dedicated section with macro-photography close-ups of key design details and trims, such as: {details_trims}.

- **The Final Styling:** Show key physical accessories, like {key_accessories}, interacting with other elements on the board to suggest a complete look and tell a story.

**Final Image Style:**
- The final image should be a professional studio photograph: editorial, tactile, atmospheric, and rich with narrative detail.
- **Negative Prompts:** Avoid text, watermarks, logos, brand names, and any likeness of recognizable public figures. The image must be clean and professional.
"""


# Prompt for the final garment shot.
FINAL_GARMENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
A full-body editorial fashion photograph for a high-end magazine lookbook, featuring the '{key_piece_name}'.

**Art Direction & Photography:**
- **Creative Guidance:** {photographic_style_guide}
- **Technical Execution:** The photograph must have a shallow depth of field, keeping the garment's texture and details in sharp, tactile focus while the background is softly blurred.

**Subject & Styling:**
- **Model Demographics:** The subject is a professional fashion model who is {target_gender}, in the {target_age_group} age range, and of {target_model_ethnicity} ethnicity.
- **Model Persona:** {model_persona}. The subject embodies the core spirit of the collection.
- **Garment Details:** The model is wearing the '{key_piece_name}', a garment defined by its modern '{silhouette}' silhouette. It is crafted from {main_fabric}, and its material properties are rendered with photorealistic detail: a texture that feels '{main_fabric_texture}', a weight of {main_fabric_weight_gsm} gsm that creates a '{main_fabric_drape}' drape, and a '{main_fabric_finish}' finish.
- **Pattern & Construction:** {pattern_description} {lining_description}
- **Styling:** The look is completed with {styling_description}, styled to feel authentic and personally curated, not like a mannequin.

**Scene & Composition:**
- **Setting:** {narrative_setting}
- **Primary Shot:** The composition is a full-body portrait.
- **Action:** The model should have a dynamic, candid pose that suggests natural movement, capturing a moment in a story rather than a static pose.

**Style Keywords & Negative Constraints:**
- **Positive Keywords:** Editorial, Photorealistic, Cinematic, Tactile, High-Detail, Authentic.
- **Negative Keywords:** Avoid {negative_style_keywords}, nsfw, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, poor quality, watermarks, logos, text overlays, and any likeness of real public figures or celebrities.
