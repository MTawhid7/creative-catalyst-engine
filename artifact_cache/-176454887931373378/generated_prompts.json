  "The Voluminous Sleeve Blouse": {
    "mood_board": "\nA professional and atmospheric fashion designer's mood board, laid out on a raw concrete or linen surface. The board's purpose is to evoke the mood, story, and tactile world of a single garment: 'The Voluminous Sleeve Blouse'.\n\n**Art Direction & Composition:**\n- The composition is a top-down flat-lay, arranged as a dynamic, slightly overlapping collage that suggests a creative work-in-progress.\n- The scene is lit by soft, diffused light, as if from a large studio window, creating a narrative and emotional mood.\n- Include a printed, Polaroid-style portrait of a professional fashion model with artistic and expressive features. This portrait represents the garment's wearer and should be an object clipped or pinned into the flat-lay.\n\n**Core Visual Elements:**\n- **The Material Story:** Feature hyper-realistic, tactile fabric swatches with visible technical details, arranged to show their texture and drape.\n  - Crisp / Cotton Poplin / 120 gsm / Structured drape / Matte finish\n      - Smooth / Satin-look Polyester / 100 gsm / Fluid drape / Lustrous finish\n      - Sheer / Silk Organza Blend / 30 gsm / Crisp drape / Transparent finish\n- Alongside the fabrics, include a focused color palette arranged with official, Pantone-like color chips for: Ecru Cream, Emerald Green, Deep Sapphire.\n\n- **The Print & Pattern Language:** Include printed samples or sketches of the key patterns used in the garment.\n  - Micro Floral Print / All-over print / 2.5cm scale\n\n- **The Craftsmanship Details:** Feature a dedicated section with macro-photography close-ups of key design details and trims, such as: Shirring at shoulder and cuff, Elasticated cuffs, Fabric-covered buttons, Delicate self-fabric ties.\n\n- **The Final Styling:** Show key physical accessories, like Simple, elegant clutches, Structured mini bags and shoulder bags, Sleek heels (minimalist strappy sandals, pointed-toe pumps, elegant mules), interacting with other elements on the board to suggest a complete look and tell a story.\n\n**Final Image Style:**\n- The final image should be a professional studio photograph: editorial, tactile, atmospheric, and rich with narrative detail.\n- **Negative Prompts:** Avoid text, watermarks, logos, brand names, and any likeness of recognizable public figures. The image must be clean and professional.\n",
    "final_garment": "\nA full-body editorial fashion photograph for a high-end magazine lookbook, featuring the 'The Voluminous Sleeve Blouse'.\n\n**Art Direction & Photography:**\n- **Creative Guidance:** Lighting should be bright, clean, and commercially appealing, utilizing soft, even illumination to highlight garment details and ensure broad visual appeal. Shots should be dynamic and energetic, capturing movement and the 'now' of fashion. Use versatile lenses (e.g., 24-70mm or 70-200mm) to allow for both full-look and detail shots, maintaining a sharp, vibrant aesthetic. The overall mood should be aspirational yet accessible, confident, and fresh, reflecting the rapid pace of trend adoption and immediate wearability.\n- **Technical Execution:** The photograph must have a shallow depth of field, keeping the garment's texture and details in sharp, tactile focus while the background is softly blurred.\n\n**Subject & Styling:**\n- **Model Demographics:** The subject is a professional fashion model who is Female, in the Young Adult (18-35) age range, and of Diverse ethnicity.\n- **Model Persona:** The model embodies the confident, trend-savvy energy of a street style star, effortlessly blending aspirational runway aesthetics with the relatable, accessible charm of an everyday fashionista, inspiring immediate desire and wearability.. The subject embodies the core spirit of the collection.\n- **Garment Details:** The model is wearing the 'The Voluminous Sleeve Blouse', a garment defined by its modern 'Balloon Sleeve' silhouette. It is crafted from Cotton Poplin, and its material properties are rendered with photorealistic detail: a texture that feels 'Crisp', a weight of 120 gsm that creates a 'Structured' drape, and a 'Matte' finish.\n- **Pattern & Construction:** The garment features a 'Micro Floral Print' pattern, applied as a All-over print. Bodice fully lined in lightweight cotton voile; sleeves unlined for maximum volume and drape.\n- **Styling:** The look is completed with High-waisted denim jeans and Tailored wide-leg trousers, styled to feel authentic and personally curated, not like a mannequin.\n\n**Scene & Composition:**\n- **Setting:** A hyper-modern, almost sterile design-to-production lab. Sleek, reflective surfaces of polished concrete and brushed steel gleam under an array of cool, LED strip lights and strategically placed ring lights. A silent, automated conveyor belt glides through the space, carrying a mix of raw fabric bolts, half-finished garments, and perfectly styled, ready-to-ship 'statement tops.' Large, translucent digital screens flash rapidly with runway imagery, trend analytics, and social media feeds, casting fleeting, colorful reflections across the room. The air hums with the low thrum of unseen machinery and the faint, crisp scent of new synthetic fabric and ozone. A single, elevated platform, bathed in a soft, artificial spotlight, awaits the next 'main character' moment, surrounded by a subtle echo of a pulsing, electronic beat. The scene is set during the Late night, deep into a production cycle. The weather is Controlled, air-conditioned environment, oblivious to the outside world.\n- **Primary Shot:** The composition is a full-body portrait.\n- **Action:** The model should have a dynamic, candid pose that suggests natural movement, capturing a moment in a story rather than a static pose.\n\n**Style Keywords & Negative Constraints:**\n- **Positive Keywords:** Editorial, Photorealistic, Cinematic, Tactile, High-Detail, Authentic.\n- **Negative Keywords:** Avoid bespoke, artisanal, haute couture (in an inaccessible way), niche, exclusive, avant-garde (if not broadly appealing), slow fashion, heritage, vintage (unless a specific trend), dull, uninspired, obscure, overly conceptual, abstract, dark, moody, overly artistic (if it sacrifices product clarity), complex, cluttered, dated, high-investment, understated, subtle, nsfw, deformed anatomy, extra limbs, poor quality, watermarks, logos, text overlays, and any likeness of real public figures or celebrities.\n"
