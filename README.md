Of course. This is the final and most important piece of documentation, reflecting all the sophisticated improvements we've made to the architecture and user experience.

This improved `README.md` includes:
*   A new **"Deep Ethos Analysis"** key feature.
*   An updated architecture diagram and processor list showing the new `EthosClarificationProcessor`.
*   A corrected repository structure that removes the non-existent DALL-E client.
*   The new, elegant "Sortable Slug" folder naming convention in the "Outputs" section.
*   Cleaned-up environment variable and troubleshooting sections.

Here is the complete, final `README.md` file.

The **Creative Catalyst Engine** is an AI-powered, idea-to-image pipeline that turns a simple creative brief into a multi-format fashion intelligence package: a structured trend report (JSON), art-directed narrative prompts, and final editorial-quality images.

It uses a composable, multi-stage pipeline to deconstruct user input, perform a deep analysis of the underlying creative ethos, synthesize research, and emit validated, typed outputs. With a robust fallback path and a semantic L1 cache, it’s designed for both creative excellence and technical resilience.

## Key Features

*   **Intelligent Briefing**
    Starts from a vague request and infers a complete, context-aware brief (brand category, audience, attributes).

*   **Deep Ethos Analysis**
    Goes beyond keywords to understand the user's core philosophy—analyzing for unspoken values like craftsmanship, sustainability, or market positioning to guide the creative process.

*   **Direct Web Synthesis**
    Uses the model’s built-in search tools to perform broad research and synthesize findings, ensuring outputs are current and relevant.

*   **Divide-and-Conquer Synthesis**
    Breaks the report generation into small, reliable, schema-driven steps to produce a perfectly structured and validated JSON report.

*   **Resilient Fallback Path**
    If web synthesis is insufficient, auto-pivots to a robust, multi-step knowledge-only path to ensure a high-quality report is always generated.

*   **L1 Report Caching**
    ChromaDB-backed semantic cache makes re-runs of similar briefs near-instant and cost-efficient.

*   **Automated Output Management**
    Generates elegant, human-readable folder names and automatically manages a clean, rolling history of recent results.

## Architecture Overview

A modern, modular **Composable Pipeline Architecture**: discrete **Processors** orchestrated by a central **Orchestrator**. Each processor does one thing well and passes typed artifacts downstream.

## Setup

### 1) Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/creative-catalyst-engine.git
cd creative-catalyst-engine
```

### 2) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell):
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3) Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4) Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the repo root:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

> `settings.py` reads these variables at runtime. Keep `.env` out of version control.

---

## Running the Engine

The primary interaction point is the `USER_PASSAGE` inside `catalyst/main.py`. Update it with your creative brief:

```python
# catalyst/main.py (snippet)
USER_PASSAGE = """
I prefer timeless, bespoke tailoring made from rare fabrics, with attention to every stitch. Exclusivity and craftsmanship are non-negotiable.
"""
```

Then run from the project root:

```bash
python -m catalyst.main```

---

## Outputs

On each run, the engine creates an elegantly named, timestamped folder under `./results/` and updates a `latest` symlink to point to it for easy access.

Inside the run folder you’ll find:

*   `itemized_fashion_trends.json` — the validated `FashionTrendReport`
*   `generated_prompts.json` — structured narrative prompts
*   `debug_run_artifacts.json` — a complete log of all data from the run

Example layout:

```
results/
├── 20250826-103000_afrofuturist-royal-court/
├── 20250826-114512_coastal-grandmother/
├── 20250826-142005_timeless-bespoke-tailoring/
└── latest -> 20250826-142005_timeless-bespoke-tailoring/
```

The system also automatically manages this folder, keeping only the most recent runs as defined in `settings.py`.

---

## Cache Management

The L1 semantic cache accelerates repeat or similar briefs.

*   **Purge the cache** (use after major prompt changes or to force a fresh synthesis):

```bash
python clear_cache.py
```

*   **Cache behavior**
    The `CacheManager` generates a deterministic key from stable, user-driven parts of the deconstructed brief. On a cache hit, the pipeline skips research/synthesis and goes straight to reporting.

---

## Configuration

Core configuration lives in `catalyst/settings.py`. Common knobs:

*   **Model/API**: `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME` for the core AI.
*   **I/O**: `RESULTS_DIR`, `LOGS_DIR`, and `KEEP_N_RESULTS` for managing outputs.
*   **Caching**: `CACHE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` to tune the sensitivity of the semantic cache.

> Tip: Prefer environment variables for secrets and environment-specific overrides.

---

## Troubleshooting

*   **No output / empty research**
    Ensure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid and allows tool-use/search. If web synthesis returns little content, the orchestrator will fall back automatically.

*   **Rate limits / timeouts**
    The client has built-in retry logic, but for persistent issues, check your API usage limits.

*   **`latest` symlink not created (Windows)**
    Run your shell as Administrator or navigate directly to the most recent timestamped folder under `results/`.

*   **Cache didn’t update after prompt change**
    Purge via `python clear_cache.py`. The cache key is deterministic; small wording changes may still produce a cache hit if the meaning is the same.
