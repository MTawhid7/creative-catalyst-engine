# clear_cache.py

"""
A utility script to completely clear all caches for the
Creative Catalyst Engine.

This script permanently deletes both the ChromaDB vector index and the
cached artifact directory defined in the project settings.

It should be used when you want to force the engine to re-process all
information from scratch, for example, after making major changes to the
prompts, models, or the underlying data logic.
